# 🚀 My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on that showcase my skills in software development, problem-solving, and technical innovation.

## 💻 Featured Projects

### 🔍 Java Water Quality Detector
**Technologies:** Java, JavaFX, Image Processing, Graph Theory

Millions of people rely on unsafe water sources, and over 50% of South Africa’s rural households lack reliable water access. To address the limitations of traditional testing—such as inconsistent manual observations, slow processing, and poor pollution tracking—a Java-based desktop application is developed for automated water quality detection. The system uses graph-based techniques for faster, more accurate classification and similarity detection of water samples, categorizing them (e.g., undrinkable, contaminated, dirty) and identifying contamination trends effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Smart Edge pruning
- Adaptive super pixels
- Accurate progress bar
- Robin hood probing
- Alpha based similarity detection

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented complex graph algorithms for image analysis
- Designed scalable architecture for image processing pipeline
- Optimized performance for real-time detection

### 📁 File Iterator
**Technologies:** Java, Serialization, Memory Management, I/O Operations

The **Efficient Object Serialization Handler** is a Java library designed to solve common issues with Java’s built-in serialization, such as high memory usage, stream corruption, and complex resource management.

It introduces an **ObjectWriter** class that allows memory-efficient reading and writing of serialized objects, ensuring that only one object is kept in memory at a time. The library also manages stream headers correctly to prevent file corruption when writing multiple times, provides clean resource handling via the `Closeable` interface, and simplifies iteration over serialized objects.

Overall, it delivers a reliable, lightweight, and convenient solution for handling large datasets and maintaining file integrity in Java object serialization.


**Key Features:**
- Memory-efficient object serialization
- Stream-safe file iteration
- Single-object memory footprint
- Robust error handling
- Header Management

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented custom serialization protocol
- Solved stream corruption issues in file I/O
- Optimized memory usage for large datasets

### 🤖 Python Chatbot
**Technologies:** Python, GUI Development, Web Scraping, Turtle Graphics

This project is a **Python-based chatbot** developed for the **University of Johannesburg Business School (UJ JBS)** final presentation. It functions as a **smart Q&A assistant** with an intuitive **Tkinter graphical interface**, designed to engage users interactively.

The chatbot features a **dictionary-based knowledge system** for quick predefined responses and supports **hot-swapping**, enabling team members to integrate modules seamlessly. It also uses **web scraping** to answer dynamic or unknown queries in real time. Additionally, it incorporates **Turtle Graphics**, allowing users to command the bot to draw shapes and fractals—blending creativity with computational logic.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language processing for Q&A
- Web scraping for real-time information
- Interactive Turtle graphics visualization
- User-friendly GUI interface

**Technical Highlights:**
- Integrated multiple Python libraries seamlessly
- Implemented web scraping with error handling
- Created engaging visualizations with Turtle graphics
