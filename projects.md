## 📦 Open-Source & Developer Tools

<br>
<br>

### 🧩 ORM-DAO-Simplified (NPM Package)

**Technologies:** TypeScript, Node.js, MySQL, DAO Pattern

**ORM-DAO-Simplified** is a lightweight, type-safe Data Access Object (DAO) library designed as a practical alternative to heavyweight ORMs. It gives developers full control over SQL while reducing boilerplate and enforcing clean separation between business logic and database access.

The library emphasizes **performance, transparency, and maintainability**, making it well-suited for production systems where predictable queries and fine-grained control are required.

**Key Features:**

* Type-safe DAO abstractions using TypeScript generics
* Reusable CRUD operations with parameterized queries
* Transaction support and structured error handling
* Minimal overhead compared to traditional ORMs

**Technical Highlights:**

* Designed repository-style architecture for clean data access
* Focused on explicit SQL execution for performance and clarity
* Published and maintained as a reusable NPM package

### 🌐 Express HTTP Status Handler (NPM Package)

**Technologies:** Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, REST APIs

**Express HTTP Status Handler** is a lightweight utility that standardizes HTTP responses in Express applications. It simplifies API development by reducing repetitive response code and enforcing consistent status codes and messages across endpoints.

The package improves **readability, maintainability, and error handling** in RESTful APIs.

**Key Features:**

* Centralized HTTP status codes and response messages
* Simplified success and error response handling
* Reduced boilerplate in Express controllers
* Easy integration into existing Express projects

**Technical Highlights:**

* Designed for clean API response abstraction
* Improved consistency across REST endpoints
* Published and documented as an NPM package

### 🔍 Java Water Quality Detector
**Technologies:** Java, JavaFX, Image Processing, Graph Theory

Millions of people rely on unsafe water sources, and over 50% of South Africa’s rural households lack reliable water access. To address the limitations of traditional testing—such as inconsistent manual observations, slow processing, and poor pollution tracking—a Java-based desktop application is developed for automated water quality detection. The system uses graph-based techniques for faster, more accurate classification and similarity detection of water samples, categorizing them (e.g., undrinkable, contaminated, dirty) and identifying contamination trends effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Smart Edge pruning
- Adaptive super pixels
- Accurate progress bar
- Robin hood probing
- Alpha based similarity detection

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented complex graph algorithms for image analysis
- Designed scalable architecture for image processing pipeline
- Optimized performance for real-time detection

### 📁 File Iterator
**Technologies:** Java, Serialization, Memory Management, I/O Operations

The **Efficient Object Serialization Handler** is a Java library designed to solve common issues with Java’s built-in serialization, such as high memory usage, stream corruption, and complex resource management.

It introduces an **ObjectWriter** class that allows memory-efficient reading and writing of serialized objects, ensuring that only one object is kept in memory at a time. The library also manages stream headers correctly to prevent file corruption when writing multiple times, provides clean resource handling via the `Closeable` interface, and simplifies iteration over serialized objects.

Overall, it delivers a reliable, lightweight, and convenient solution for handling large datasets and maintaining file integrity in Java object serialization.


**Key Features:**
- Memory-efficient object serialization
- Stream-safe file iteration
- Single-object memory footprint
- Robust error handling
- Header Management

**Technical Highlights:**
- Implemented custom serialization protocol
- Solved stream corruption issues in file I/O
- Optimized memory usage for large datasets

### 🤖 Python Chatbot
**Technologies:** Python, GUI Development, Web Scraping, Turtle Graphics

This project is a **Python-based chatbot** developed for the **University of Johannesburg Business School (UJ JBS)** final presentation. It functions as a **smart Q&A assistant** with an intuitive **Tkinter graphical interface**, designed to engage users interactively.

The chatbot features a **dictionary-based knowledge system** for quick predefined responses and supports **hot-swapping**, enabling team members to integrate modules seamlessly. It also uses **web scraping** to answer dynamic or unknown queries in real time. Additionally, it incorporates **Turtle Graphics**, allowing users to command the bot to draw shapes and fractals—blending creativity with computational logic.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language processing for Q&A
- Web scraping for real-time information
- Interactive Turtle graphics visualization
- User-friendly GUI interface

**Technical Highlights:**
- Integrated multiple Python libraries seamlessly
- Implemented web scraping with error handling
- Created engaging visualizations with Turtle graphics

### 💬 Web QR Reaction App
**Technologies:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, QR Code API

The **Web QR Reaction App** is a collaborative React-based web application developed as a practice project to explore modern front-end development concepts. The project aimed to integrate QR code generation and user interaction features while experimenting with responsive UI design and dynamic state management in React.

Although incomplete, the project served as a hands-on introduction to component-based architecture, real-time data handling, and user interface composition using reusable React components.

**Key Features (Planned & Implemented):**
- Dynamic QR code generation for user inputs  
- Interactive UI for user reactions or responses  
- Modular React component structure for scalability  
- Integration testing of state updates and event handling  
- Exploration of external APIs for QR data encoding  

**Technical Highlights:**
- Practiced building functional and class-based React components  
- Implemented state management and event-driven rendering  
- Focused on responsive layouts and clean component styling  
- Collaborative workflow using GitHub for version control
