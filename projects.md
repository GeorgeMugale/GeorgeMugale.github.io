## 📦 Open-Source Developer Tools

### 🧩 ORM-DAO-Simplified

**NPM Package | TypeScript, Node.js, MySQL**

A lightweight, type-safe Data Access Object (DAO) library designed as a practical alternative to heavyweight ORMs. This package gives developers full control over SQL while reducing boilerplate and enforcing clean separation between business logic and database access.

**The Problem It Solves**

Traditional ORMs can be heavy, opaque, and sometimes unpredictable. ORM-DAO-Simplified provides the structure and type safety of an ORM without sacrificing performance or SQL visibility. It's perfect for developers who want the best of both worlds.

**Key Features**

- Type-safe DAO abstractions using TypeScript generics
- Reusable CRUD operations with parameterized queries
- Built-in transaction support for complex operations
- Structured error handling for robust applications
- Minimal overhead compared to traditional ORMs
- Clean repository-style architecture

**Technical Highlights**

- Designed with repository pattern for clean data access
- Explicit SQL execution for performance and clarity
- Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- Published and actively maintained on NPM
- Full documentation with code examples

**What I Learned**

This project taught me the importance of balancing abstraction with control. I learned how to design APIs that are both powerful and intuitive, and gained deep insights into database connection pooling, transaction management, and TypeScript's advanced type system.

### 🌐 Express HTTP Status Handler

**NPM Package | Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript**

A lightweight utility that standardizes HTTP responses in Express applications. This package simplifies API development by reducing repetitive response code and enforcing consistent status codes and messages across all endpoints.

**The Problem It Solves**

Building RESTful APIs often involves writing the same response handling code over and over. This leads to inconsistencies, more code to maintain, and potential bugs. Express HTTP Status Handler centralizes all response logic in one place.

**Key Features**

- Centralized HTTP status codes and response messages
- Simplified success and error response handling
- Consistent response format across entire API
- Reduced boilerplate in Express controllers
- Easy integration into existing Express projects
- Customizable response formats

**Technical Highlights**

- Clean API response abstraction layer
- Improved consistency across REST endpoints
- Middleware-friendly architecture
- Published as reusable NPM package
- Well-documented with usage examples

**Impact**

This tool has streamlined my API development workflow significantly. What used to take multiple lines of response handling now takes a single, readable function call.

## 💻 Featured Applications

### 🔍 Java Water Quality Detector

**Desktop Application | Java, JavaFX, Graph Theory, Image Processing**

A sophisticated desktop application that uses graph-based algorithms to analyze water samples and detect contamination. This project addresses a real-world problem: millions of people rely on unsafe water sources, and over 50% of South Africa's rural households lack reliable water access.

- Real-time progress tracking with accurate progress bar
- Robin Hood probing for optimized hash table performance
- Alpha-based similarity detection for contamination trends
- Multiple contamination levels (undrinkable, contaminated, dirty)

**Technical Highlights**

- Implemented complex graph algorithms (MST, Graph Edit Distance)
- Designed scalable architecture for image processing pipeline
- Optimized performance for real-time detection
- JavaFX-based intuitive user interface
- Custom data structures for memory efficiency

**What I Learned**

This project pushed me to implement advanced algorithms I'd only seen in textbooks. I learned about:
- Graph theory practical applications
- Image processing optimization techniques
- Memory-efficient data structure design
- UI/UX for scientific applications

### 📁 File Iterator - Efficient Object Serialization Handler

**Java Library | Serialization, Memory Management, I/O Operations**

A Java library that solves critical issues with Java's built-in serialization: high memory usage, stream corruption, and complex resource management. This tool is essential for applications that need to handle large datasets efficiently.

**The Problem It Solves**

Java's default serialization can be problematic:
- High memory consumption with large object collections
- Stream corruption when writing multiple times
- Complex resource management
- Difficult iteration over serialized data

**The Solution**

The File Iterator library provides an ObjectWriter class that enables memory-efficient serialization with guaranteed file integrity.

**Key Features**

- Memory-efficient object serialization
- Stream-safe file iteration
- Single-object memory footprint during iteration
- Automatic header management to prevent corruption
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Clean resource management via Closeable interface

**Technical Highlights**

- Custom serialization protocol implementation
- Solved stream corruption issues in file I/O
- Optimized memory usage for large datasets
- Implements Java best practices (Closeable, try-with-resources)
- Comprehensive error handling

**Real-World Applications**

Perfect for:
- Processing large log files
- Handling big data collections
- Database backup/restore operations
- Data migration tools

**What I Learned**

This project deepened my understanding of Java I/O, memory management, and the importance of proper resource handling. I learned how to design APIs that are both powerful and foolproof.
