## 🎯 Featured Projects

        <h3>Java Water Quality Detector</h3>
        <p>Millions of people rely on unsafe water sources, and over 50% of South Africa’s rural households lack reliable water access. To address the limitations of traditional testing—such as inconsistent manual observations, slow processing, and poor pollution tracking—a Java-based desktop application is developed for automated water quality detection. The system uses graph-based techniques for faster, more accurate classification and similarity detection of water samples, categorizing them (e.g., undrinkable, contaminated, dirty) and identifying contamination trends effectively.</p>
